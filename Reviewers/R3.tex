\begin{revcomment}
	Compared with previous works, the current work further considers the complex overlapping range relationship between sensors. Therefore, the authors should spend a lot of effort to emphasize this contribution in Section I.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	Thanks for the valuable suggestion.
	We have revised Section 1 to better highlight the challenge introduced by this overlapping range relationship between sensors, and to underscore their practical relevance in real-world scenarios.

	The revised description of this relationship:
	\begin{changes}
		This altitude-dependent coverage creates intricate spatial relationships between sensors, manifesting in various overlapping patterns: partial overlap, full containment, reverse containment, and disjointness.
		Moreover, these relationships become even more complex as communication range changes with altitude, creating challenges that have not been fully addressed in previous research.
		For example, in Fig.~1, as the altitude increases, sensor $S_1$ initially overlaps with $S_2$, but eventually becomes fully contained by $S_2$.
		Such overlapping range relationship better captures the complexity of real-world scenarios and provides practical value for UAV-assisted data collection.
		Capturing and fully exploiting these altitude-dependent ranges is crucial, since it enables the data from a single sensor to be collected across multiple sessions and fundamentally influences the order of data collection.
	\end{changes}
	The third challenge in the revised manuscript:
	\begin{changes}
		Due to the complex overlapping patterns of sensor data transmission ranges, the UAV is often simultaneously located within the ranges of multiple sensors. Consequently, determining the optimal data collection sequence becomes highly challenging.

	The system model assumes an idealized scenario without incorporating real-world path loss effects (e.g., fading, shadowing). This limits the practical use of the proposed algorithm.

\begin{revcomment}
	The claim of ``near-optimal performance'' for SSF-ACO-Online lacks a clear benchmark (e.g., theoretical bounds or exhaustive search). Provide a quantitative comparison to support this conclusion.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment.
	We recognize that the term ``near-optimal'' was not precise. Our intention was to indicate that SSF-ACO-Online performs closely to the offline algorithm SSF-ACO. We have revised the abstract to clarify this point and removed the term ``near-optimal'' to avoid confusion.
	\begin{changes}
		Extensive simulations demonstrate that SSF-ACO significantly outperforms baseline approaches in energy efficiency, and SSF-ACO-Online achieves comparable performance with energy consumption 1.24\% higher than offline counterpart in average.
	\end{changes}

\begin{revcomment}
	The robustness of the SSF-ACO and SSF-ACO-Online algorithms to network dynamics (e.g., node mobility) is not evaluated. Include tests under time-varying conditions to demonstrate adaptability.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We appreciate the reviewer's comment on the network dynamics.
	The ground nodes (GNs) mobility, failures, and the computational latency of SSF-ACO-Online are discussed in the following.

	\textbf{GN mobility.}
	GN mobility is an important factor in various UAV-assisted systems.
	However, our current work focuses on data collection from stationary sensors.
	In the scenarios we consider, the sensors are fixed in the environment to monitor infrastructures or natural conditions.
	Admittedly, a number of existing studies~\cite{GNmob1, GNmob2, GNmob3, GNmob4} have investigated GN mobility.
	In these studies, GNs typically refer to mobile user devices with significant movement, such as user-carried devices~\cite{GNmob1,GNmob2} or vehicles~\cite{GNmob3,GNmob4}, which are fundamentally different from the stationary GNs considered in our work.

	\textbf{Failures.}
	Failures may occur either before or during data transmission.
	Failures before transmission will result in the sensor being undetectable by the UAV.
	On the other hand, failures during the transmission process will lead to a disruption in the connection between the UAV and the sensor.
	The UAV will attemp to reconnect and, after reaching the maximum number of reconnection attempts, will abandon the connection.
	Regardless of whether reconnection is successful, the scheduling will be re-planned to ensure energy efficiency.

	The paper uses multiple important symbols, but a comprehensive table of symbols and definitions is missing. Adding such a table would enhance readability and help readers locate information more easily.

	We have improved the discussion about learning-based algorithms for UAV-assisted systems in Section 2.3.
	\begin{changes}
		Learning-based methods, particularly deep learning (DL) and RL, gained popularity in recent years, as they learned complex parameters or action policies during the training process.
		In UAV-assisted mobile edge computing systems, Lin \etal~\cite{b-DL} proposed a parametrized dueling deep Q-network to maximize the UAV's energy efficiency.
		The problem was formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which facilitated the modeling of problems involving both continuous variables (\eg trajectory) and discrete variables (\eg data collection decision and task offloading decision).
		To maximize the total throughput and energy efficiency, Chen \etal~\cite{b-RL} formulated long-term UAV-aided data collection problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and addressed it by a multi-agent DRL algorithm.
		However, the maximum number of ground nodes that could be served in \cite{b-DL} and \cite{b-RL} was only 6 and 8, respectively, as the extremely high computational complexity became unacceptable when the number of ground nodes increased.
		Hao \etal~\cite{hao-minlp} formulated a task offloading problem in a UAV-assisted mobile edge computing system as a MINLP, and then transformed it into a MDP.
		The problem was solved by a DRL algorithm.
		Zhong \etal~\cite{zhong-minlp} also applied a similar approach to address a task offloading and resource allocation problem.
		Despite their successful application to larger-scale problems, challenges still remain in the context of the JUSAS problem, particularly in modeling the environment and designing the reward function, including aligning the reward signal with the objective and dealing with sparse rewards.
