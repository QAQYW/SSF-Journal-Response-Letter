	Alg.4 does not specify the specific implementation of ``Roulette-Wheel-Selection'', which needs to supplement pseudocode or reference standard methods.

	The vertical energy consumption is assumed to be linear related to the altitude difference, which seems oversimplified, more justification is needed.

	The difference between the transmission range model of Equation (17) and literature [35] is not fully explained, and the improvement points or advantages need to be clearly defined.

	There are too many curves in Figure 8 and the colors are similar, so it is difficult to distinguish them. It is suggested to optimize the color matching or add mark symbols

	Some minor suggestions:\\
	(1) The the first sentence in subsection 2.1, ``UAV'' → ``UAVs''.\\
	(2) Second paragraph of subsection 2.1, ``maintaining'' → ``maintained''.\\
	(3) Second paragraph of subsection 2.2, ``maintaining'' → ``and maintain''.\\
	(4) The ``='' in table 1.\\
	(5) Add $k \neq k'$ to equation (11), and $i \neq i'$ to equation (12).\\
	(6) The parameter $\mathbb{S}$ of algorithm 1 and 2 is neither used nor updated.\\
	(7) Line 2 of Algorithm 3, why set 20 to $Z$?
