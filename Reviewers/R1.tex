\begin{revcomment}
	This paper fails to justify the selection of heuristic factors $(\alpha, \beta)$ in SSF-ACO. You should conduct grid search experiments to demonstrate parameter sensitivity or cite theoretical foundations for ACO parameter tuning.

	We agree that the title is somewhat misleading.
	We therefore changed it in the current version of the manuscript.

\begin{revcomment}
	Current experiments only cover small-scale scenarios ($\leq 30$ nodes), it should extend to more nodes to should the scalibility of algorithm.

	We totally agree. We also added the following to the new version of the manuscript
	\begin{changes}
		This really important sentence was added to the paper.

\begin{revcomment}
	The assumptions of linear GN deployment and complete GN knowledge are restrictive and not sufficiently justified. Please provide a detailed discussion of the assumptions, including their implications for real-world applicability and potential extensions.

	Could the proposed models and algorithms be adapted for 3D GN layouts?

	Some statements have inconsistent tenses (e.g. ``Our previous work [20] investigated...''). vs. (``we propose...''), need to unify the full text tense; The reference format should be checked according to IEEE standards (e.g. URL references [6] are not standardized).
\end{revcomment}

	Thank you for the comment.
	We have carefully reviewed the tense usasge throughout the manuscript and corrected the inconsistent expressions to ensure consistency. Additionally, we have standardized the website reference format according to IEEE Reference Guide.
